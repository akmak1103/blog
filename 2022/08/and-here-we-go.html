        <p>Once I start W, how will I manage X?<br>
            What about Y?<br>
            Z would be easy. I know how to do it.<br>
            But A and B?<br>
            Oh god!</p>
        <p>I have had this conversation many times in my head. And I guess this is how most of us work . We are very
            good at imagining our future self (even when we are uncertain about present).</p>
        <p>This handicaps us in one of the two ways:</p>
        <p>1. We think all the things that will work. This kicks the brain into satisfaction mode and hence
            motivation to act is lost.</p>
        <p>2. We think of all the things that could go wrong. We start fearing and avoid heading in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>I have been a victim of this pattern.</p>
        <p>Until today.</p>
        <p>How did I break it?</p>
        <p>I learned that actions ➡️ Δ emotions is a faster route than Δ emotions ➡️ actions. It is easier to change
            your mind and emotions by taking action. Changing actions by trying to think and feel differently is an
            uphill battle.</p>
        <p>This will make more sense to you once you try it.</p>
        <p>&quot;A small step towards your goal is more valuable than the knowledge gathered about the journey.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>Let's see how far this step takes me!</p>

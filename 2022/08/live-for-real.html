        <p>Do you have any dreams? Goals? Targets?</p>
        <p>Are you working hard enough to achieve them?</p>
        <p>While the productivity folks might tell you to optimize each second of your life, you are missing away most of it.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you something.</p>
        <p>The life which you are living today was once your dream. Do you see it? If not complete, I am sure at least half of it.</p>
        <p>Why do you not savour this? Why is there no gratitude but only the fire to get ahead in this race?</p>
        <p>Take a break. From your goals. And your smartphone. Spend some time reflecting on this beautiful life of yours. Enjoy a good meal with your family. Take a walk in park. See the sunshine. And live for real!</p>
